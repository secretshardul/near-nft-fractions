# NFT fractionalization on Near

## Core features
- Fractionalization: Stake NFT and get fungible tokens representing its fractions. The following parameters will be set during fractionalization:
   1. Total fraction count
   2. Exit price
- Redeem: Pay the exit price to redeem the NFT. Each fraction holder gets renumerated according to their fraction share.

## Good to have
- Marketplace for NFT fractions
- Integration with liquidity pools
- Explore NIFTEX vaults and index funds: They allow multiple NFTs to be pooled and fractionalized together.
- $NEAR_FACTIONALIZATION token

## Work plan
- Study whitepapers of ethereum based fractionalization projects.
- Create UML diagrams for contract flow
- Study Rust
- Near protocol study:
   1. New standards for fungible and non-fungible tokens.
   2. Cross-contract calls using Rust.
- Develop contracts using the UML diagrams.
